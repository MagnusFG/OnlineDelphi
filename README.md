# OnlineDelphi

This project (OnlineDelphi) comprises the php implementation of a platform for conducting online-based live and delphi surveys. Surveys are loaded from a mySQL database and input is stored there. Adding and editing surveys is done by direct access to the database, as well as reading the stored survey data. Different question types are implemented (multiple-choice questions, dropdown selection, rating scales continuous and discrete, ranking). 

There are two types of surveys to choose from: 
- Delphi method: Two-level. First round: Survey. Second round: Survey and graphical representation of the response distributions of all participants from the previous round.
- Live Survey: After completion of the survey, graphical representation of the response distributions.
